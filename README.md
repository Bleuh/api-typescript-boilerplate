# Api typescript boilerplate

API boilerplate in Typescript.

## How to launch

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/Bleuh/api-typescript-boilerplate

# Install dependencies
yarn
```

I recommanded to use docker to launch the project.
You can find the install process [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

```bash
docker-compose up
```

If you don't have docker, use the default `yarn start`, but you need to have the right environment (mongodb) in your `.env`.

You can now use the api on `http://localhost:3000/`
